This is a simple work in progress game, I'm making this so I can learn Java & LibGDX.
The orcs.png is a sprite sheet of an enemy character, the unfinishedchars1.PNG is a sprite sheet of a friendly character.
You'll have to get them elsewhere, I got them from opengameart and wont be adding them to the repo.
